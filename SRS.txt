Here is the full story of your Employee Management System.

1. What Happens When the Application Starts
The application loads the main 
App
 component.
It checks local storage (browser memory) to see if a user is already logged in from a previous session.
If a user is found, their data is loaded into the Context API (temporary application memory), and they are instantly logged in.
If no user is found, the system shows the Login Screen.
2. How the Login Process Works
The user enters their email and password on the login screen.
When they click "Log In", the frontend sends this data to the Backend API.
The backend handles the request:
It checks the Admin collection in MongoDB to see if the email matches an admin.
If not found, it checks the 
Employee
 collection.
It verifies if the password is correct.
If successful, the backend sends back the user's details, including their role (admin or employee).
The frontend saves this user data in local storage (so they stay logged in if they refresh) and updates the global application state.
3. How the System Decides Admin vs. Employee
The decision happens entirely based on the role property returned from the backend after login.
If role === 'admin', the system prepares to show the Admin interface.
If role === 'employee', the system prepares to show the Employee interface.
4. How the Correct Dashboard is Shown
The main 
App
 component watches the current user state.
It uses conditional logic:
Is user logged in? No → Show Login.
Is user logged in? Yes → Check Role.
Role is Admin? → Render <AdminDashboard />.
Role is Employee? → Render <EmployeeDashboard />.
5. Full Admin Dashboard Flow
Where Data Comes From:

The admin dashboard automatically fetches fresh data from the backend (GET /api/users) as soon as it loads.
How a New Employee is Created:

Admin clicks "Add Employee" button.
Fills out the form (First Name, Email, Password).
Frontend sends this data to the backend.
Backend creates a new document in the 
Employee
 collection in MongoDB.
The list updates instantly to show the new employee.
Where Employee Data is Stored:

Permanent data (Name, Email, Password, Role) is stored in MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database).
How Tasks are Created and Assigned:

Admin fills out the "Create Task" form (Title, Date, Assign To, Category, Description).
Frontend sends this to the backend (POST /api/tasks).
Backend creates a new task document in the 
Tasks
 collection in MongoDB.
Backend also finds the assigned employee and increments their "New Task" counter in the database.
How Employee Task Counters are Calculated:

For the Admin view, these counters come directly from the Employee document stored in MongoDB. The backend maintains these counts (e.g., when a task is created or completed, the backend updates the numbers).
How Task List and Details Work:

Task List: Admin sees a list of all employees. Clicking on an employee name navigates to a specific page (/employee-tasks/:id).
Detail View: This page fetches only the tasks assigned to that specific employee ID from the backend and displays them.
6. Full Employee Dashboard Flow
Where Employee Data Comes From:

The dashboard receives the logged-in user's basic info (Name) from the global Context.
How Employee Tasks are Fetched:

The dashboard automatically asks the backend: "Give me all tasks assigned to MY user ID".
Backend searches the 
Tasks
 collection in MongoDB for documents where assignedTo matches the employee.
It returns the list of tasks to the frontend.
How Task Counters are Calculated:

Unlike the Admin view, the Employee dashboard calculates these numbers live on the frontend.
It counts how many tasks in the fetched list have status "new", "active", "completed", or "failed".
What Happens When Marking a Task as Done/Failed:

Employee clicks "Accept", "Done", or "Fail".
Frontend sends a request to the backend: "Change status of Task X to 'completed'".
Backend updates the task status in MongoDB.
Backend also updates the employee's counters (e.g., -1 Active, +1 Completed).
The page refreshes to show the new status and updated numbers.
How Task Detail Page Works:

Clicking a task opens /task/:taskId.
This page asks the backend for the details of just that one task using its unique ID.
7. How Data Moves Through the System
User Action: User clicks a button (e.g., "Create Task").
Frontend: React gathers the data and sends an HTTP request (via Axios).
Backend: Express server receives the request, specific Controller function runs.
Database: Controller talks to Mongoose, Mongoose updates MongoDB.
Response: MongoDB confirms success → Backend sends "OK" JSON response.
Frontend Update: React receives "OK", updates the screen (UI) to show the new state.
8. Where Data is Stored
MongoDB (The Vault):
Users (Admins and Employees).
Tasks (Titles, descriptions, statuses, dates).
This data survives even if you restart the server.
Backend Server Memory (The Processor):
Holds data only temporarily while processing a request (e.g., validating a password).
Data is lost once the request finishes.
Frontend State (The Sketchpad):
Holds temporary UI data (what you are typing in a form, is the "Loading..." spinner showing?).
Lost if you refresh the page.
Context API (The Backpack):
Holds "Global" data needed everywhere, specifically the Logged In User object.
Accessible by any component in the app.
9. Page Navigation Flow
Root (/): Checks login. Redirects to Login or Dashboard.
Login -> Dashboard: Happens automatically on successful authentication.
Dashboards:
Admin Dashboard: Shows "Create Task" form and "All Employees" list.
Employee Dashboard: Shows "Task Counters" and "My Task List".
Admin Actions:
Click "Add Employee" → Opens Add Employee page.
Click Employee Name → Opens that employee's specific task list.
Employee Actions:
Click "Accept/Done/Fail" → Updates the current view (no page change).
Click Task Title → Opens Task Details page (shows full description).
Common Actions:
Click "Edit Profile" → Opens Edit Profile page.
Click "Log Out" → Clears local storage, resets Context, redirects to Login.
